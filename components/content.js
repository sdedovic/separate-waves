                    <p className='bio-text'>Watching Stevan Dedovic at work is like being in the eye of hurricane. In
                        one moment, without a paint brush in sight, he adds and subtracts layers from large-scale
                        acrylic paintings. In the next, he’s behind a computer screen inputting numbers that, often
                        quite literally, spiral into the clean geometric patterns of generative art. He describes his
                        process as a series of decisions that “delegate control” to various processes ranging from
                        automated machines and computer coding, to the chemical reactions of paint and hot water. Stevan
                        draws inspiration from rusted highway fences and other natural images that explore the passing
                        of time. He currently lives in the Wicker Park neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois.</p>

                        and pencils. The majority of her paintings are influenced by processes she learned from
                        monoprinting and etching while at DePaul. Her paintings range from semi-sculptural abstract
                        pieces to works modeled after photos or objects from real life. She enjoys using tape as much as
                        a paint brush when painting. She is currently working on illustrations for the children’s book
                        Epistemology for Babies. In August she will be moving to Nashville to pursue a PhD in Philosophy
                        at Vanderbilt University.</p>

                    <p className='bio-text'>Sean Griffin often works on multiple paintings in a single night. He
                        describes his work as learning to “take things apart and put them back together in creative
                        ways.” While much of his work finds its basis in destructive processes, he is also known for his
                        inventive use of color and found materials. Sean will incorporate the plastic packaging of the
                        canvas in his work. Recently he has been working with pouring mediums, giving his work a sense
                        of motion. Aside from art, Sean also applies a similar mindset to music. He has been known to
                        create everything from analog loop tapes to beats with sounds sourced from Gameboy games. He
                        currently lives in Palatine, Illinois.</p>

                        at her job as a graphic designer, her artwork isn’t determined by somebody else’s vision. She
                        enjoys using the color purple and has recently been trying to add it to her work in surprising
                        ways. When asked about the inspiration behind her work she cites relationships, explaining that
                        “other people are something I can’t control...painting is a way to deal with that frustration.”
                        In viewing art, Jenn appreciates everything from photo-realistic paintings to abstract pieces
                        that experiment with color and texture. Those viewing her work will see similar experimentation
                        along with a sense of visual balance. Jenn currently lives in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of
                        Chicago and works as a flash content manager and graphic designer.</p>

                        Influenced by Henri Matisse and John Zabawa, Andy works in a variety of mediums from paints to
                        paper cutting. He especially enjoys applying his designs to objects that perform other
                        functions, such tote bags and pillows. The goal of his work is “to create spaces and experiences
                        that evoke a sense of wonder by organizing physical material, image, and sound.” His work
                        instills a sense of calm and contemplation and he enjoys projects that require multiple steps.
                        He is currently working on an animation project, which will become the music video for “On the
                        Moor,” by his band, Sun Silo. His work is on display at The Branch gallery in Racine, Wisconsin,
                        and is often featured in the posters and merchandise for his bands, Sun Silo and The
                        Oscillators. Andy currently based in Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p>

                <p className='bio-text'>Aaron Joseph makes sad, emotional music that puts people in a good mood. He starts by playing around with different tunings and chords on his guitar, then writes a melody and adds words.

Aaron’s clever lyrics are accompanied by his wide and dynamic vocal range and raw guitar. Aaron enjoys playing small, intimate shows because it allows him to make a genuine connection with the audience. He is also a part of local band, Where’s Fernando?, which will be playing their farewell show at the Tonic Room on July 20th.

                <p className='bio-text'>Andy Danstrom is a drummer and producer based in Chicago. When producing, he draws from a wide range of influences; elements of vapor-wave and drum and bass as well as contemporary classical and jazz can be found in what he does. As a drummer, his ears are naturally focused towards timbre, rhythm and texture and his music tends to focus on those qualities. The end result is contemplative music wrought with nuanced rhythms and a complex layering of chimes, bells, synths and atmospheric textures. You can check out his first EP “Before I knew myself and my loneliness” on YouTube (see link below) and he is currently working on his second project which he plans to release sometime later this year. For this particular performance he will be creating an improvised set of ambient music in the hopes of creating a sonic environment to explore the themes of the art being presented.</p>

                <p className='bio-text'>Such Jam Much chill was formed in September 2019 with the intent of playing DIY house shows. In recent months the group has become more focused and consistent while still remaining true to their improvisational style. Influenced by lo-fi jam bands such as FKJ, Lettuce, Vulfpeck, and local band Dasset, Such Jam Much Chill, works with the energy of their audience to make every show a fun and unique experience. Isaiah Sanderman organized the band where he plays saxophone, keyboard, and contributes vocals. Other members include Bailey Gordon on bass, Vincent Ippolito on drums, and Ricky Hendrix on guitar. In many ways, Such Jam Much Chill represents what can form out of connections in the Chicago music scene. The band is currently planning a tour of Chicago record stores (dates TBA) and has a show at Uncommon Ground with Punting Baxter on September 6th.</p>
